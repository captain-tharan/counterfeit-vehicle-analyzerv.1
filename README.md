# Counterfeit Vehicle Analyzer v.1

## Introduction

The Counterfeit Vehicle Analyzer is a Python-based project aimed at detecting counterfeit vehicles through license plate recognition and color analysis. By utilizing computer vision techniques and optical character recognition (OCR), this tool assists in identifying potential counterfeit vehicles by comparing their characteristics with a database of known vehicles.

## Features

- Vehicle type identification (car, truck, bike, SUV).
- License plate recognition using OCR.
- Detection of counterfeit vehicles based on vehicle type and dominant color analysis.

## Technologies Used

- Python programming language
- OpenCV library for computer vision tasks
- pytesseract for OCR
- SQLite for database operations
- smtplib for sending email notifications
- SSL for secure email communication
